### 30DaysCodeChallenge:
Javascript 30 days challenge. All through 30 days, I'll be building things, a lot of things. I never did decide on a side project, but thatâ€™s okay! Over the first 30 days of the challenge, I focused on exploring different areas of programming I have not had the chance to explore yet, pure Javascript methods and functions.

#### The basic idea of this challenge is as follows:
- Spend a minimum of 1 hour per day coding for 30 Days.
- Tweet my progress on twitter, instagram, linkedIn with the #30DaysCodeChallenge tag
- Encourage other people taking the challenge by sharing and interacting with their tweets.
